# ðŸ–¤ Black Object Segmentation in Night Photo

This Python project detects and segments **black-colored objects** from a **night photo** using color-based segmentation in the **HSV color space**.  
It highlights dark regions (like shadows, objects, or vehicles) and saves both the mask and segmented result.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

Nighttime images often have uneven lighting, making it hard to detect dark or shadowed objects.  
By converting the image to the **HSV color model**, we can isolate black regions accurately using a defined intensity range.

## ðŸ§¾ Features

- Converts the image to **HSV** for accurate color segmentation.  
- Creates a **binary mask** of black areas.  
- Generates a **segmented image** showing only black objects.  
- Saves both the **mask** and **output image** for inspection
